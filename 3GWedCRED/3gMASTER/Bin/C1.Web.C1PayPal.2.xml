      <remarks>
            Use the ImageUrl property to specify the URL of an image to display in the Image control. 
            You can use a relative or an absolute URL. A relative URL relates the location of the image 
            to the location of the Web page without specifying a complete path on the server. The path 
            is relative to the location of the Web page. This makes it easier to move the entire site 
            to another directory on the server without updating the code. An absolute URL provides the 
            complete path, so moving the site to another directory requires that you update the code.

      <remarks>
        <p>The amount is specified in US dollars by default, but you can specify other currencies
            using the <see cref="T:System.Currency" /> property.</p>
        <p>Because this property is of type double, you need to edit data binding expressions that set its value. 
            By default, when you bind this property to a database field, Visual Studio generates a line that looks 
            like this:</p>
        <code>
            // doesn't work
            c1Button.ItemPrice = &lt;% DataBinder.Eval(Container, “DataItem.UnitPrice”) %&gt;
            </code>
        <p>This doesn't work because the value returned is a string and the assignment will fail at 
            runtime. To fix it, you need to replace the above code with the following:</p>
        <code>
            // works fine
            c1Button.ItemPrice = &lt;% double.Parse(DataBinder.Eval(Container, “DataItem.UnitPrice”).ToString()) %&gt;

      <summary>
            Gets or sets the unit price for the item being sold.
            </summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>The amount is specified in US dollars by default, but you can specify other currencies
            using the <see cref="T:System.Currency" /> property.</p>
        <p>Because this property is of type double, you need to edit data binding expressions that set its value. 
            By default, when you bind this property to a database field, Visual Studio generates a line that looks 
            like this:</p>
        <code>
            // doesn't work
            c1Button.ItemPrice = &lt;% DataBinder.Eval(Container, “DataItem.UnitPrice”) %&gt;
            </code>
        <p>This doesn't work because the value returned is a string and the assignment will fail at 
            runtime. To fix it, you need to replace the above code with the following:</p>
        <code>
            // works fine
            c1Button.ItemPrice = &lt;% double.Parse(DataBinder.Eval(Container, “DataItem.UnitPrice”).ToString()) %&gt;
            </code>
