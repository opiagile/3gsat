Hello there,

Thanks for your purchase and patronage.

Please find enclosed herein a copy of the Carousel.swc component. 
Also enclosed is the Carousel help file which is also located on our website: www.flexcubed.com/documentation

There you will see a detailed description of how to use the component. You will also find a sample Flex application in this folder using the component with  sample images with the corresponding xml file. Simply create a new Flex project and use the accompanying main.mxml.

Please take note that with the Flex version, you always need to call the draw method for it to load and create the movies.

For example: carouselInstance.draw();

Please refer to the MainCode.as file.

Should you experience any bug or need assistance, please do contact us at: ask@flexcubed.com

-Flexcubed Team
